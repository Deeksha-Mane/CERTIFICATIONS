# 🏆 Competitions & Certifications

Hey, I’m Deeksha.
A third-year Computer Science & Engineering student who genuinely enjoys solving problems, exploring ideas, and building things that work.

I have a soft spot for DSA — there’s something satisfying about untangling logic step by step, especially on LeetCode, where I keep showing up just to get a little better each time.

I’m also drawn to AI, the idea that machines can think, adapt, and even surprise us. And then there’s Web Development, where I love creating interfaces that feel good to use — small websites that come alive with logic and design.

This repo holds a part of that journey — certifications, competitions, and projects I’ve enjoyed along the way.

Keeping the fire alive — with the fuel of dedication. 🔥
